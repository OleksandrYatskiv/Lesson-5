            <p><b>2022 Chevrolet Corvette</b></p>
            <p>The 2022 Chevrolet Corvette claims the top spot in the luxury sports car class, thanks to its value
                proposition, lightning-quick acceleration, precise handling, comfortable and well-trimmed interior, and
                intuitive tech features.</p>
        </div>

            <p><b>2023 Audi R8</b></p>
            <p>The 2023 Audi R8 rides off into the sunset on a high note â€“ more specifically, the blare of its V10
                engine. It's brutally fast, thrilling to drive and dressed to the nines with quality materials, though
                it's not exactly practical, fuel-efficient or even remotely affordable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="./2022_porsche_718_cayman_angularfront.jpg" alt="2022 Porsche Cayman">
            <p><b>2022 Porsche Cayman</b></p>
            <p>The 2022 Porsche Cayman is everything you want a luxury sports car to be: fast, agile, and posh. However,
                some rivals offer more standard features.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="./2022_porsche_718_boxster_angularfront.jpg" alt="2022 Porsche Boxster">
            <p><b>2022 Porsche Boxster</b></p>
            <p>The 2022 Porsche Boxster climbs toward the top of the luxury sports car class partly on the strength of
                its well-rounded performance and high predicted reliability score.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="./2022_porsche_911_0_angularfront.jpg" alt="2022 Porsche 911">
            <p><b>2022 Porsche 911</b></p>
            <p>The 2022 Porsche 911 ranks highly among luxury sports cars thanks in part to its enticing acceleration,
                standard-setting handling, and impeccable quality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="./2023_BMW_8-Series_1.jpg" alt="2023 BMW 8-Series">
            <p><b>2023 BMW 8-Series</b></p>
            <p>The 2023 BMW 8 Series combines thrilling performance with a luxurious cabin, representing the best of
                what the brand has to offer.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="./2021_lexus_lc_angularfront.jpg" alt="2021 Lexus LC">
            <p><b>2021 Lexus LC</b></p>
            <p>The 2021 Lexus LC finishes in the top half of our luxury sports car rankings. It's fun to drive, with a
                first-rate interior and a comfortable ride, even if it doesn't have the blinding athleticism of some
                classmates.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="./2022_Lexus_LC_1.jpg" alt="2022 Lexus LC">
            <p><b>2022 Lexus LC</b></p>
            <p>The 2022 Lexus LC ranks midpack among luxury sports cars. It delivers spry acceleration, well-rounded
                handling attributes, and a classy cabin, but it comes up short in rear-seat and cargo space, and its
                infotainment controls are cumbersome.</p>
